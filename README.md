# RNA-seq 2G

Two-group comparison of differential expression (DE) is the most common analysis of transcriptome data. For RNA-seq data, the comparison is usually performed on a gene-level matrix of read counts,'with the read counts corresponding to the number of sequencing reads mapped to each gene in each RNA-seq sample.

## Compare DE methods

### resistance to outliers

How analysis results will be affected by outliers, in terms of number of DEGs

### (practically) differentiate genes with extreme or moderate DEGs

Over-sensitive methods will fail to differentiate

### Run time

Dependence of run time on sample size


## "Bad" method

Bridge: Very slow, inconsistent output, highly disagree with other methods
